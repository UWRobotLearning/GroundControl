For Isaac Lab, assets are stored on the Omniverse Nucleus server. However, at times, it may be
needed to store the assets locally (for debugging purposes). In such cases, this directory can be
used for temporary hosting of assets.

Anything specific to Ground Control can be found inside the `data` directory,
we recommend following the same structure as the IsaacLab Nucleus directory `Isaac/IsaacLab`. Please check the extension's README for further details.
